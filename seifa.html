<h1>Socioeconomic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA)</h1>
<div id="data-sources" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>All data was sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census">Census of Population of
Housing</a> <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/about/data-services/application-programming-interfaces-apis/data-api-user-guide">Application
Programming Interface (API)</a>. Specifically, <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/people-and-communities/socio-economic-indexes-areas-seifa-australia/latest-release">Socioeconomic
Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)</a> were available for 2011, 2016 and
2021.</p>
<p>As with other variables, 2021 <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/statistical-geography/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs">Australian
Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS)</a> areas were used for all
boundaries, visualised at the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/main-structure-and-greater-capital-city-statistical-areas">Statisical
Area 2 (SA2)</a> level. However, SEIFA data was only available at the
SA2 level for each census year, and so indexes were aggregated manually
from the SA1 level to agree with 2021 SA2 boundaries. This process is
described in more detail below under Methods.</p>

<h3>Included variables</h3>
<p>The SEIFA variables chosen for estimation were all indexes enumerated
by the ABS. Previous reporting at the Sydney Local Health District has
focused on the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (IRSD), but
each indexes has specific strengths and limitations, and are intended
for different purposes. Broadly, the four indexes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD)
<ul>
<li>Provides a general measure of advantage and disadvantage</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD)
<ul>
<li>Provides a measure of an area’s relative disadvantage and
<em>lack</em> of disadvantage</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Index of Education and Occupation (IEO)
<ul>
<li>Provides a measure of an area’s education and occupation variables,
and to understand the relationship between income, education, and
employment within an area</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Index of Economic Resources (IER) focuses on Economic advantage and
disadvantage.
<ul>
<li>Provides a measure of an area’s access to economic resources
(e.g. understanding housing as well as income).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p>Raw SEIFA variable scores were sourced at the SA1 level for their
respective Census (e.g. 2011 SEIFA scores for 2011 SA1 boundaries),
along with Usual Resident Populations (URPs) for these areas. SA1
boundaries for 2011 and 2016 were intersected with 2021 SA2 boundaries,
with a threshold of 50% taken for inclusion. That is, if an SA1 was at
least 50% within the corresponding 2021 SA2, it was assigned to that
area. In almost all cases this resulted in a one-to-one match. Scores
were then population weighted using URPs to obtain an overall score for
the 2021 SA2, with population weighted scores ranked and categorised
into deciles.</p>
<p>This method was adapted from the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/socio-economic-indexes-areas-seifa-australia-methodology/2021">standard
approach</a> used by the ABS for assigning indexes within each census
year.</p>
<p>Note that only SA2s for with sufficient population for valid
estimation were included. This meant excluding the bottom 5% of SA2s by
total population for each year, which included mostly non-residential
SA2s, such as ‘Sydney Airport’ or ‘Rookwood Cemetery’.</p>

<div id="limitations" class="section level3">
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>SEIFA indexes are <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/socio-economic-indexes-areas-seifa-australia-methodology/2021">calculated
differently each year</a>, and are not intended to be used for time
series analyses. Nonetheless, methods for most indexes have changed only
slightly between 2016 and 2021, and so superficial comparisons may be
made, albeit cautiously.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic status is a highly complex issue and no one index, nor
combination of indexes, is intended to capture the full spectrum of
socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage. Indexes are designed to be
indicative only, with full acknowledgement that important factors
influencing socioeconomic status may not be adequately captured by any
of these indexes.</p>
