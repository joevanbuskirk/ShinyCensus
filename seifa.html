<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census of Population and
Housing (the Census) provides summaries by area across many key
demographic variables. However, areas enumerated in the Census are
defined by the ABS and</p>
<ul>
<li>Are adjusted from year to year, precluding simple longitudinal
assessment; and</li>
<li>Are not defined at non-ABS area boundaries, such as Local Health
District</li>
</ul>
<p>With the 2021 Census, the ABS has released specific time series
Census datasets to allow for longitudinal comparisons in Census
variables across consistent geographic boundaries. This allows for
direct and valid comparisons to be made across Census variables for a
given area over time, without need for conversion or aggregation.</p>
<p>The Public Health Research Analytics and Methods for Evidence unit
(PHRAME) has launched an online platform for the visualisation of this
time series Census data from 2011, 2016 and 2021, covering three broad
topics -</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic Variables, such as population size, income and age</li>
<li>Broad indicators of Cultural and Linguistic Diversity, such as
language spoken at home and country of birth</li>
<li>ABS indexes of socioeconomic status</li>
<li>Self-reported long-term health conditions, included in 2021 for the
first time</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific variables were selected using a combination of relevance to
clinical and non-clinical services within SLHD and those that have been
reported in previous Census summaries, among those that were available
across time. All variables with the exception of the newly included
self-reported long-term health conditions are reported across the three
most recent censuses (specifically 2011, 2016 and 2021).</p>

<h2>Method - Socioeconomic Index For Areas (SEIFA)</h2>
<div id="data-sources" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>All data was sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census">Census of Population of
Housing</a> <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/about/data-services/application-programming-interfaces-apis/data-api-user-guide">Application
Programming Interface (API)</a>. Specifically, all <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/people-and-communities/socio-economic-indexes-areas-seifa-australia/latest-release">SEIFA
indexes</a> enumerated by the ABS were included. Broadly, the four
indexes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage
(IRSAD), focussing on both advantage and disadvantage</li>
<li>the Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD), focussing
on relative socio-economic disadvantage</li>
<li>the Index of Education and Occupation (IEO), focussing on relative
Education and Occupation advantage and disadvantage, including variables
detailing educational attainment, occupation, income, and
employment</li>
<li>the Index of Economic Resources (IER), focussing on Economic
advantage and disadvantage (e.g. housing as well as income).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Statistical method</h3>
<p>Raw SEIFA variable scores were sourced at the SA1 level for their
respective Census (e.g. 2011 SEIFA scores for 2011 SA1 boundaries),
along with Usual Resident Populations (URPs) for these areas. SA1
boundaries for 2011 and 2016 were intersected with 2021 SA2 boundaries,
with a threshold of 50% taken for inclusion. That is, if an SA1 was at
least 50% within the corresponding 2021 SA2, it was assigned to that
area. In almost all cases this resulted in a one-to-one match. Scores
were then population weighted using URPs to obtain an overall score for
the 2021 SA2, with population weighted scores ranked and categorised
into deciles.</p>
<p>This method was adapted from the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/socio-economic-indexes-areas-seifa-australia-methodology/2021">standard
approach</a> used by the ABS for assigning indexes within each census
year.</p>
<p>Note that only SA2s for with sufficient population for valid
estimation were included. This meant excluding the bottom 5% of SA2s by
total population for each year, which included mostly non-residential
SA2s, such as ‘Sydney Airport’ or ‘Rookwood Cemetery’.</p>
<p>Overall LHD estimates were calculated as the proportion of SA2s in an
LHD in the highest two quintiles (i.e. the top 40% of all scores). Note
that across the state there should be <em>exactly</em> 40% of all SA2s
within these two quintiles (for scores indexed at the state level).
Hence, any proportion higher or lower than 40% this for a specific LHD,
can be directly compared to the distribution across the state for that
year.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>SEIFA indexes are <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/socio-economic-indexes-areas-seifa-australia-methodology/2021">calculated
differently each year</a>, and are not intended to be used for time
series analyses. Nonetheless, methods for most indexes have changed only
slightly between 2016 and 2021, and so superficial comparisons may be
made, albeit cautiously.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic status is a highly complex issue and no one index, nor
combination of indexes, is intended to capture the full spectrum of
socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage. Indexes are designed to be
indicative only, with full acknowledgement that important factors
influencing socioeconomic status may not be adequately captured by any
of these indexes.</p>
