<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Public Health Research Analytics and Methods for Evidence (PHRAME) is
a collaboration between Sydney Local Health District and the University
of Sydney. In 2022, the District and the University established PHRAME
to embed research-informed epidemiological and data science methods
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>support production of actionable evidence for decision-makers</li>
<li>add value to a wide range of health and population data through
novel uses</li>
<li>create opportunities for capacity-building and training</li>
<li>enable scalable research and collaboration by identifying
applications within and outside the district</li>
</ul>
<p>PHRAME’s vision is to be an exemplar of excellence as a partnership
with the University, supporting the district’s strategic vision of
excellence in health and healthcare for all. This will be achieved
by:</p>
<ul>
<li>producing actionable evidence to inform decision-making across the
district</li>
<li>applying research-honed methods and analytics to address real-world
questions</li>
</ul>
