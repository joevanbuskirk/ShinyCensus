<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census of Population and
Housing (the Census) provides summaries by area across many key
demographic variables. However, areas enumerated in the Census are
defined by the ABS and</p>
<ul>
<li>Are adjusted from year to year, precluding simple longitudinal
assessment; and</li>
<li>Are not defined at non-ABS area boundaries, such as Local Health
District</li>
</ul>
<p>With the 2021 Census, the ABS has released specific time series
Census datasets to allow for longitudinal comparisons in Census
variables across consistent geographic boundaries. This allows for
direct and valid comparisons to be made across Census variables for a
given area over time, without need for conversion or aggregation.</p>
<p>The Public Health Research Analytics and Methods for Evidence unit
(PHRAME) has launched an online platform for the visualisation of this
time series Census data from 2011, 2016 and 2021, covering three broad
topics -</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic Variables, such as population size, income and age</li>
<li>Broad indicators of Cultural and Linguistic Diversity, such as
language spoken at home and country of birth</li>
<li>ABS indexes of socioeconomic status</li>
<li>Self-reported long-term health conditions, included in 2021 for the
first time</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific variables were selected using a combination of relevance to
clinical and non-clinical services within SLHD and those that have been
reported in previous Census summaries, among those that were available
across time. All variables with the exception of the newly included
self-reported long-term health conditions are reported across the three
most recent censuses (specifically 2011, 2016 and 2021).</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>All data was sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census">Census of Population of
Housing</a> <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/about/data-services/application-programming-interfaces-apis/data-api-user-guide">Application
Programming Interface (API)</a>. Specifically, <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/long-term-health-conditions">long
term health conditions</a> were available only for 2021, while <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/disability-and-carers/core-activity-need-assistance-assnp">core
activity need for assistance</a> was available for the full data
series.</p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-method" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical method</h3>
<p>Variables were age standardised using the June 2001 <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3101.0Feature+Article1Mar%202013">standard
Australian population</a>, as recommended by the ABS and the Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). The Census API categorises age
slightly differently for long term health conditions and core activity
need for assistance, with long term health conditions categorising age
into nine groups (0-14, 15-24, and then ten year age groups up to 85+),
while core activity need for assistance categorises age into eleven
groups (0-4, 5-14, 15-19, 20-24, and then ten year age groups up to
85+). Age groupings were used as supplied by the API, with the standard
population aggregated accordingly.</p>
<p>Direct age standardisation was used, with confidence intervals
calculated using the epitools package in R, which employs a method based
on the gamma distribution as described by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9131766/">Fay and Feuer
(1997)</a>.</p>
<p>Only SA2s for with sufficient population for valid estimation were
included. This meant excluding the bottom 5% of SA2s by total population
for each year, which included mostly non-residential SA2s, such as
‘Sydney Airport’ or ‘Rookwood Cemetery’.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level3">
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>All data reported in the census are self-reported, with no validation
or cross reference to registry and/or administrative data. The validity
of self-reported estimates of long-term health conditions has been shown
to be questionable, and variable according to condition (e.g. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2447848/">Smith et
al, 2008</a>), and this should be taken into account when interpreting
these estimates. Further validation is required before these estimates
can be taken at face value.</p>
<p>Usual resident populations were used to standardise the estimates in
order to match the numerator. That is, census counts were used without
additional correction for undercounting (e.g. <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/information-papers/methodology-used-final-rebased-population-estimates-june-2021">Estimated
Resident Populations</a>), as there are no equivalent corrected
estimates for the conditions enumerated. This is unlikely to introduce
substantial bias to the estimates, unless particular conditions are
overrepresented in certain populations known be undercounted.</p>
<p>In addition, inconsistent age grouping may lead to some bias in the
estimates, for example if a condition is especially prevalent in an age
group that has been aggregated. The AIHW <a href="https://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/327276">recommend</a> generally
using five-year age groups, however these were unavailable in the
current dataset.</p>
