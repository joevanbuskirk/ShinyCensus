<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>All data was sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census">Census of Population of
Housing</a> <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/about/data-services/application-programming-interfaces-apis/data-api-user-guide">Application
Programming Interface (API)</a>. Specifically, <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/long-term-health-conditions">long
term health conditions</a> were available only for 2021, while <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/disability-and-carers/core-activity-need-assistance-assnp">core
activity need for assistance</a> was available for the full data
series.</p>
<p>2021 <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/statistical-geography/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs">Australian
Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS)</a> areas were used for all
boundaries, visualised at the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/main-structure-and-greater-capital-city-statistical-areas">Statisical
Area 2 (SA2)</a> level. That is, while historical data is visualised for
2011 and 2016, these have been populated according to the updated 2021
ASGS boundaries in the time series tables.</p>

<div id="included-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Included variables</h3>
<p>The variables chosen for estimation were informed from the Census. In
the case of core activity assistance, this was chosen due to being one
of the only questions on long term health conditions that has been asked
consistently and is thus available as a time series. All other long term
health conditions were included in the 2021 Census for the first time,
and all variables were thus included.</p>
</div>
<div id="method" class="section level3">
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>Variables were age standardised using the June 2001 <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3101.0Feature+Article1Mar%202013">standard
Australian population</a>, as recommended by the ABS and the Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). The Census API categorises age
slightly differently for long term health conditions and core activity
need for assistance, with long term health conditions categorising age
into nine groups (0-14, 15-24, and then ten year age groups up to 85+),
while core activity need for assistance categorises age into eleven
groups (0-4, 5-14, 15-19, 20-24, and then ten year age groups up to
85+). Age groupings were used as supplied by the API, with the standard
population aggregated accordingly.</p>
<p>Usual resident populations were used to standardise the estimates in
order to match the numerator. That is, census counts were used without
additional correction for undercounting (e.g. <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/information-papers/methodology-used-final-rebased-population-estimates-june-2021">Estimated
Resident Populations</a>), as there are no equivalent corrected
estimates for the conditions enumerated.</p>
<p>Direct age standardisation was used, with confidence intervals
calculated using the epitools package in R, which employs a method based
on the gamma distribution as described by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9131766/">Fay and Feuer
(1997)</a>.</p>
<p>Note that only SA2s for with sufficient population for valid
estimation were included. This meant excluding the bottom 5% of SA2s by
total population for each year, which included mostly non-residential
SA2s, such as ‘Sydney Airport’ or ‘Rookwood Cemetery’.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level3">
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>All data reported in the census are self-reported, with no validation
or cross reference to registry and/or administrative data. The validity
of self-reported estimates of long-term health conditions has been shown
to be questionable, and variable according to condition (e.g. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2447848/">Smith et
al, 2008</a>), and this should be taken into account when interpreting
these estimates. Further validation is required before these estimates
can be taken at face value.</p>
<p>In addition, inconsistent age grouping may lead to some bias in the
estimates, for example if a condition is especially prevalent in an age
group that has been aggregated. The AIHW <a href="https://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/327276">recommend</a> generally
using five-year age groups, however these were unavailable in the
current dataset.</p>
