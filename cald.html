<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census of Population and
Housing (the Census) provides summaries by area across many key
demographic variables. However, areas enumerated in the Census are
defined by the ABS and</p>
<ul>
<li>Are adjusted from year to year, precluding simple longitudinal
assessment; and</li>
<li>Are not defined at non-ABS area boundaries, such as Local Health
District</li>
</ul>
<p>With the 2021 Census, the ABS has released specific time series
Census datasets to allow for longitudinal comparisons in Census
variables across consistent geographic boundaries. This allows for
direct and valid comparisons to be made across Census variables for a
given area over time, without need for conversion or aggregation.</p>
<p>The Public Health Research Analytics and Methods for Evidence unit
(PHRAME) has launched an online platform for the visualisation of this
time series Census data from 2011, 2016 and 2021, covering three broad
topics -</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic Variables, such as population size, income and age</li>
<li>Broad indicators of Cultural and Linguistic Diversity, such as
language spoken at home and country of birth</li>
<li>ABS indexes of socioeconomic status</li>
<li>Self-reported long-term health conditions, included in 2021 for the
first time</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific variables were selected using a combination of relevance to
clinical and non-clinical services within SLHD and those that have been
reported in previous Census summaries, among those that were available
across time. All variables with the exception of the newly included
self-reported long-term health conditions are reported across the three
most recent censuses (specifically 2011, 2016 and 2021).</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>All data was sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census">Census of Population of
Housing</a> <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/about/data-services/application-programming-interfaces-apis/data-api-user-guide">Application
Programming Interface (API)</a>. Specifically, both country of birth of
person (<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/country-birth-person-bplp">BPLP</a>)
and language used at home (<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/language-used-home-lanp">LANP</a>)
were used for the full data series.</p>
<p>The top 10 countries of birth (excluding Australia), and top 10
languages other than English spoken at home, were calculated by
population within the Sydney Local Health District. These specific
countries and languages are visualised separately at the SA2 level.</p>

<h3>Statistical method</h3>
<p>For proportions, numerators were calculated as the total population
within that subcategory, while the denominator was the total population
with a valid response. In this way, all estimates have a <em>meaningful
complement</em>. For example, if 42% of a population in an SA2 are born
overseas, it can be assumed that 58% of that area were born in
Australia. That is, the proportions will sum to 100%. Similarly, if 12%
of the population in an area were to speak Spanish as a preferred
language at home, it can be assumed that 88% of that population <em>do
not</em> speak Spanish at home.</p>
<p>Only SA2s for with sufficient population for valid estimation were
included. This meant excluding the bottom 5% of SA2s by total population
for each year, which included mostly non-residential SA2s, such as
‘Sydney Airport’ or ‘Rookwood Cemetery’.</p>

<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>All data reported in the census are self-reported, with no validation
or cross reference to registry and/or administrative data. The validity
of self-reported estimates of Cultural and Linguistic Diversity may be
subject to bias, if certain populations are less likely to answer these
questions. As only valid responses were used in the denominator, results
would be biased if certain population were less likely to be included in
the total (i.e. total <em>valid</em> responses). This should be
considered when interpreting the results.</p>
<p>More broadly, Census counts are known to undercount certain
populations (e.g. <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/information-papers/methodology-used-final-rebased-population-estimates-june-2021">Estimated
Resident Populations</a>), and there are no suitably corrected estimates
available for the included CALD variables. This is unlikely to introduce
substantial bias to the estimates, unless counting particular
populations known be undercounted.</p>
<p>Finally, CALD is a complex and multifaceted concept, capturing
diversity across myriad aspects, including culture, community, religion
and many more. The variables available in the Census give a very broad
overview of this diversity, with full acknowledgement that many
important aspects are not covered.</p>
