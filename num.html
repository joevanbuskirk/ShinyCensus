<h3>Included variables</h3>
<p>The variables chosen for estimation were those included in the time
series tables provided by the ABS, which have historically been of
interest to the Sydney Local Health District. This is not exhaustive,
and there are many additional variables included in the time series
tables (and, indeed, the entire Census questionnaire), but it was
decided to focus on a smaller set of variables in the interest of
usability and relevance. These included</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/population-census/latest-release">Usual
resident population</a>, reflecting the count on Census night by area of
usual residence</li>
<li>Proportion born overseas, calculated using the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/country-birth-person-bplp">Country
of Birth</a> census variable, as well as
<ul>
<li>Proportion born in the 11 most common countries of birth within SLHD
(including Australia)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Proportion of people primarily speaking a language other than
English at home, calculated using the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/cultural-diversity/language-used-home-lanp">Language
used at Home</a> census variable, as well as
<ul>
<li>Proportion speaking the 11 most common languages within SLHD
(including those speaking English only)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Median personal income, calculated using the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/income-and-work/total-household-income-weekly-hind">household
income</a> census variable</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="method" class="section level3">
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>In the case of usual resident populations and median personal income,
both variables were pre-calculated by the ABS, and so were used as is.
For both proportion variables, total valid responses were used as the
denominators, with any missing or invalid responses excluded from the
total. For example, proportion born overseas is the number of people who
listed a country of birth other than Australia, divided by the number of
people people who listed <em>any</em> country of birth, with those with
missing or invalid responses excluded. In this way, the proportion of
people born overseas is the complement to those born in Australia (i.e.,
the two proportions sum to 100% for each area), and the proportion of
those speaking English only as the main language at home is the
complement to those speaking a language other than English at home.</p>
<p>Note that only SA2s for with sufficient population for valid
estimation were included. This meant excluding the bottom 5% of SA2s by
total population for each year, which included mostly non-residential
SA2s, such as ‘Sydney Airport’ or ‘Rookwood Cemetery’.</p>

<div id="limitations" class="section level3">
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Usual resident populations are known to <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/2021-census-overcount-and-undercount/latest-release">undercount
certain population</a> groups, and thus the population estimates used
are subject to some bias. While this may be small overall, it is likely
to be especially pronounced in areas with higher populations of
demographic groups known to be undercounted. This should be considered
when interpreting estimates.</p>
<p>Income data reported in the census are self-reported, with no
validation or cross reference to taxation and/or administrative data.
There is the possibility that this estimate may be biased and there has
been no correction for this. Though this bias is likely to be relatively
small when aggregated, and especially when only reporting medians, it
should be considered when interpreting estimates.</p>
<p>The exclusion of invalid responses from the denominators in the
proportions of those born overseas and those speaking a language other
than English at home may bias estimates slightly. That is, those born
overseas are slightly more likely to be <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/2021-census-overcount-and-undercount/latest-release">undercounted</a>,
and this is likely to affect overall estimates. Estimates produced here
should thus be taken as <em>indicative</em> of population distributions,
rather than objective truth.</p>
