<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census of Population and
Housing (the Census) provides summaries by area across many key
demographic variables. However, areas enumerated in the Census are
defined by the ABS and</p>
<ul>
<li>Are adjusted from year to year, precluding simple longitudinal
assessment; and</li>
<li>Are not defined at non-ABS area boundaries, such as Local Health
District</li>
</ul>
<p>With the 2021 Census, the ABS has released specific time series
Census datasets to allow for longitudinal comparisons in Census
variables across consistent geographic boundaries. This allows for
direct and valid comparisons to be made across Census variables for a
given area over time, without need for conversion or aggregation.</p>
<p>The Public Health Research Analytics and Methods for Evidence unit
(PHRAME) has launched an online platform for the visualisation of this
time series Census data from 2011, 2016 and 2021, covering three broad
topics -</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic Variables, such as population size, income and age</li>
<li>Broad indicators of Cultural and Linguistic Diversity, such as
language spoken at home and country of birth</li>
<li>ABS indexes of socioeconomic status</li>
<li>Self-reported long-term health conditions, included in 2021 for the
first time</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific variables were selected using a combination of relevance to
clinical and non-clinical services within SLHD and those that have been
reported in previous Census summaries, among those that were available
across time. All variables with the exception of the newly included
self-reported long-term health conditions are reported across the three
most recent censuses (specifically 2011, 2016 and 2021).</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>All data was sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
<a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census">Census of Population of
Housing</a> <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/about/data-services/application-programming-interfaces-apis/data-api-user-guide">Application
Programming Interface (API)</a>. Specifically, <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/population-census/latest-release">Usual
resident population (URPs)</a>, reflecting the count on Census night by
area of usual residence; Median personal weekly income, calculated using
the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/variables-topic/income-and-work/total-household-income-weekly-hind">household
income</a> census variable, and median age, in whole numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-method" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical method</h3>
<p>URPs, median ages and median incomes were all available calculated at
the SA2 level from the API. No additional summary or calculation was
conducted on these estimates. In order to obtain overall Local Health
District estimates for populations, URPs were simply summed across all
SA2s within a given LHD. In order to obtain overall Local Health
District estimates for medians, population-weighted medians were taken
across all SA2s within a given LHD.</p>
<p>As estimates were either summed or population weighted, all SA2s were
included regardless of population. This method differs slightly from
other indicators, where SA2s with populations below the 5th percentile
were excluded. However, due to the method of population weighting, any
SA2s with low populations are given relatively low weight and hence
contribute very little to the overall median.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level3">
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>As median personal weekly incomes were not adjusted for inflation,
they should only be used for comparison within years, and never
<em>between</em> years, without additional adjustment.</p>
<p>All data reported in the census are self-reported, with no validation
or cross reference to registry and/or taxation data. The validity of
self-reported estimates of income may be subject to bias, and this
should be taken into account when interpreting these estimates. Further
validation is required before these estimates can be taken at face
value.</p>
<p>Usual resident populations were used to standardise the estimates in
order to match the numerator. That is, census counts were used without
additional correction for undercounting (e.g.Â <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/detailed-methodology-information/information-papers/methodology-used-final-rebased-population-estimates-june-2021">Estimated
Resident Populations</a>). This is unlikely to introduce substantial
bias to the estimates, unless certain estimates are higher or lower in
populations known be undercounted.</p>
